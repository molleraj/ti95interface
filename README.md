# TI-95 Arduino Replacement Cassette Interface

All files in this repository related to the Arduino Uno-based replacment TI-95 cassette interface I am building. This interface will let you send and receive TI-95 programs from a Linux machine.

Plans for building the interface will be added in the future. I will be selling pre-built interfaces soon. The primary issue right now is to fix the PC to TI-95 send script/send routines.

ti95_receive.sh - to receive files from the TI-95 on the PC.
ti95_send.sh - to send files from the PC to the TI-95.
ti95_send_2.sh - to send files from the PC to the TI-95, with adjustable chunk size (bytes per transfer) and delay between sending chunks.
ti95_interface_uno.ino - sketch with send/receive PWM routines for Arduino Uno.
lunarlander.95 - sample program received with ti95_receive.sh.
